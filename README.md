<p>Encryption Standards&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instagram utilizes encryption to safeguard data transmitted between its app and servers. Key aspects include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Data Encryption: User passwords and private data are encrypted before being stored in databases. This means that even if data is compromised, it is difficult to decipher.&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>HTTPS Protocol: All traffic between the user&apos;s device and Instagram servers uses HTTPS, ensuring that data remains secure during transmission. This protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>End-to-End Encryption: While ot universally applied on Instagram, certain messaging features may employ this technology to keep conversations private. &nbsp;</p>
